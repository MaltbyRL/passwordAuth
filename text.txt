get email, password
  hash password
    will look like a bunch of jumbled up characters,
    hashing is a one way process. cant reverse it to get the password
    hash will produce same hash from same password

    salting the hash changes the result so people  cant look up hash value

  make it send a header,,
  want the front end to send a request with header.
  want every request that angular makes to have the header.
  send the cookie in the response, not in a cookie in .send()
